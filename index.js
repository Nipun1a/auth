// hey i am doing the next video stufff in this by changing tha app.js to index.js in the package.json lec 16 of sheriyans coding school learning data associations with mongoose
// if you want to run auth project then you need to change the main file in package.json from app.js to index.js
// this is because the main file is the entry point of the application and it should point to the file that starts the server
// so in this case we are changing it to index.js which is the file that starts the server
// this is a simple change but it is important to make sure that the main file is correct
